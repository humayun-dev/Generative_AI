🌧️ Struggling Life 🌧️

In the quiet hours before the dawn,
Dreams feel heavy, hope feels gone.
Each breath a battle, each step unsure,
Yet the heart still whispers, “endure, endure.”

The roads are rough, the nights are long,
The weak are silent, the brave stay strong.
Tears may fall where no one sees,
But faith still dances in the breeze.

The world may judge, the days may tire,
But pain refines like tempered fire.
For in the dark, a spark is born,
To light the way through nights of storm.

So rise again, though broken, scarred—
Life tests the soul, but heals the heart.
And when you reach the morning’s hue,
The struggle fades—the strength is you.
